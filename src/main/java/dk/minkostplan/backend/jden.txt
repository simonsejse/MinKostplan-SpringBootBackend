MySQL --- fetch ---> Hibernate Persistence Context -----> DTOs

 | SELECT r FROM Recipe r JOIN FETCH r.ingredients WHERE r.id = :id
    *  Will join on Ingredient but also the FETCH means they will be put in the HPC (Hibernate Peristence Context)
    *  Without the FETCH they are not added to the context and only r is (so the ingredients are proxies)
